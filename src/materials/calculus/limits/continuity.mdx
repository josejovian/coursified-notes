# Continuity of a Function

<Theorem>
Let $f$ be a function defined on an open interval containing all values of $x$ close to $a$. Then,  
the function $f$ is continuous at $a$ if $\lim\limits_{x\rightarrow 0}f(x)=f(a)$.
</Theorem>

There are other specific terms to describe continuity:

- $f$ is continuous from the left at $a$ if $\lim_{x\rightarrow 0^-}f(x)=f(a)$
- $f$ is continuous from the right at $a$ if $\lim_{x\rightarrow 0^+}f(x)=f(a)$
- $f$ is continuous on an open interval $(a, b)$ if $f$ is continuous for every number $k$, where $a < k < b$
- $f$ is continuous on a closed interval $[a, b]$ if $f$ is continuous for every number $k$, where $a \le k \le b$

# Continuity of a Function (2)

Suppose $f$ and $g$ are both functions that are continuous at $a$. Then, the following functions are also continuous at $a$:
- $f \pm g$
- $fg$
- $\frac{f}{g}$, if $g(a) \neq 0$.
- $cf$, where $c$ is a constant.
- $f(g(a))$, if $f$ is continuous at $g(a)$. 

The continuity of a few common functions:
- A polynomial is continuous on $(-\infty, \infty)$.
- A rational function is continuous on its domain.
- The six trigonometric functions are continuous on their respective domains.

The above information can be used to determine at which intervals is a function continuous on.

# Continuity of a Function: Example

<Example>
Identify at which intervals are the following functions continuous on:
1. $f(x)=x^2+20x+100$
2. $g(x)=\sqrt{x^2+5x+4}$
3. $h(x)=\ln{\frac{x-3}{x+2}}$
</Example>

The function $f$ is a polynomial, so it's continuous on $(-\infty, \infty)$.

To find where $g$ is continuous on, remember that **square roots cannot be negative**. We have to find at which intervals do the inner polynomial become negative. The inner quadratic polynomial can be broken into $(x+4)(x+1)$, which tells us where the roots are: $-4$ and $-1$. Test any $c$ values for each these intervals (which are obtained by splitting the domain using the roots): $(-\infty, -4)$, $(-4, -1)$, and $(-1, \infty)$. Whichever interval yields a non-negative value will be the answer to this problem. In this case, they are $(-\infty, -4]$ and $[-1, \infty)$.  

To find where $h$ is continuous on, remember that **logarithms cannot be zero or negative**. We havve to find at which intervals do the inner rational function become negative or zero. The problematic $x$ values are $3$ and $-2$. Like before, test any $c$ values for each these intervals: $(-\infty, -2)$, $(-2, 3)$ and $(3, \infty)$. Whichever interval yields a positive value will be the answer to this problem. In this case, they are $(-\infty, -2)$ and $(3, \infty)$.

# Discontinuity of a Function

There are three types of discontinuity:

## Jump Discontinuity

![Jump Discontinuity](/materials/jump_discontinuity.png "Jump Discontinuity")

This happens when $\lim\limits_{x\rightarrow a^-} f(x) \neq \lim_{x\rightarrow a^+} f(x)$

---

## Infinite Discontinuity

![Infinite Discontinuity](/materials/infinite_discontinuity.png "Infinite Discontinuity")

This happens when the function approaches infinity or negative infinity, whether from the left side or the right side.

---

## Removable Discontinuity

![Removable Discontinuity](/materials/removable_discontinuity.png "Removable Discontinuity")

This happens when $\lim\limits_{x\rightarrow a} f(x) = f(a)$, or $f(a)$ does not exist.

# **Practice:** Identifying Continuity

The functions $f$, $g$, $h$, $p$ and $q$ are defined below, along with some $x$ values.

$$
f(x)=\frac{1}{x}\text{, at }x=0
$$

$$
g(x)=\begin{cases}
x^2& \text{, } x \leq2\\
x& \text{, } x > 2\\
\end{cases}\text{, at }x=2
$$

$$
h(x)= \left \lfloor x \right \rfloor\text{, at }x=1
$$

$$
p(x)=\begin{cases}
x& \text{, } x < 4\\
x^2-4x+3& \text{, } 4 \leq x < 5\\
7.9& \text{, } x = 5\\
\sqrt{x+ 59}& \text{, } x  > 5\\
\end{cases}\text{, at }x=5
$$

$$
q(x) = \frac{1}{x^{2}-6x+9} \text{, at }x=3
$$

# **Practice:** Continuity of a Function

Given some functions $f$, $g$, and values of "$a$", determine the value of constants $c$ and $d$, so that both $f$ and $g$ are continuous on each function's value of $a$.

$$
f(x)=\begin{cases}
x+5& \text{, } x \leq-3\\
c-2x& \text{, } x > -3\\
\end{cases}
$$

$$
g(x)=\begin{cases}
d-x& \text{, } x \lt\frac{\pi}{2}\\
d \cos{x}& \text{, } x \geq \frac{\pi}{2}\\
\end{cases}
$$
