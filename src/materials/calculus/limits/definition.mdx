# What's a Limit? (1)

Let's use a simple function $f(x) = x^2$.

<Graph functions="x^2" />

If we set $x = -1$, we will have $f(-1)=1$. If we set $x = -0.1$, we will have $f(-0.1)=0.01$. If we set $x = -0.01$, we will have $f(-0.01)=0.0001$.

As we can see, if we go from anywhere on the left side to $x = 0$, we can tell that as $x$ approaches $0$ from the left side, the value of $f(x)$ will eventually approach $0$. The same also happens if we look from the right side, that is, as $x$ approaches $0$ from the right side, the value $f(x)$ will also eventually approach $0$. These sentences can be written as $\lim\limits_{x\rightarrow 0^-} f(x)= 0$ (from the left side) and $\lim\limits_{x\rightarrow 0^+} f(x)= 0$ (from the right side).

In this case, since both limits approach to the same value, we can say that the limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches $0$, is $0$. In other words, $\lim\limits_{x\rightarrow 0} f(x) = 0$. For a limit of a function as it approaches a point to exist, limits from both directions have to be the same.

# What's a Limit? (2)

<Theorem title="General Definition of Limit">
Let $f$ be a function defined on an open interval containing $a$, with the possible exception of $a$ itself (the function $f$ does not need to be defined on $a$), then $\lim\limits_{x\rightarrow a} f(x)=L$ if $f(x)$ can be made as close to $L$ by making $x$ to be sufficiently close to $a$, from both right and left side: $\lim\limits_{x\rightarrow a^+} f(x)=\lim\limits_{x\rightarrow a^-} f(x)=L$.
</Theorem>

Consider another example $f(x)$, which graph is shown below. Try predicting $f$'s limit as $x$ approaches the following values: $-6$, $-3$, $-2$, $2$, and $6$.
Note that solid (closed) dot indicate that it is included within the function's domain, and the open dot indicate otherwise. You can consider this as the difference between less than equal to, and less than. Remember that for a function to have a limit as it approaches $x$, the limit from the left and right side must be the same.

<Graph
  functions="1+4/(x+2)@[-6,2];(x-6)*(x-4)*(x-2)@[2,6]"
  asymptotes="x=-2"
  points="2,2~solid;0,2~outline;-3,-3~outline;3,-3~solid;0,6~solid;0,-6~outline"
  ranges="[8,8,-8,-8]"
/>

The following table summarizes the function $f$:

| $x$  | $f(x)$    | $\lim\limits_{x\rightarrow 0^-}$ | $\lim\limits_{x\rightarrow 0^+}$ | $\lim\limits_{x\rightarrow 0}$ |
| ---- | --------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| $-6$ | undefined | does not exist                   | $-6$                             | does not exist                 |
| $-3$ | $3$       | $-3$                             | $-3$                             | $-3$                           |
| $-2$ | undefined | $-\infty$                        | $\infty$                         | does not exist                 |
| $2$  | $2$       | $2$                              | $0$                              | does not exist                 |
| $6$  | $0$       | $0$                              | does not exist                   | does not exist                 |

# What's a Limit? (3)

Consider another example $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, which graphs are shown below. Sometimes we have to find the limit of a function as $x$ approaches $\infty$ or $-\infty$.  

<TwoColumns>
  <Graph functions="1/x-1@[-8,0];(x^2+1)/x-2@[0,8]" asymptotes="y=-1" />
  <Graph functions="(x^2-2*x)/(x^2+1)" asymptotes="y=1" />
</TwoColumns>

For the first graph $f$, we can see that:

- $\lim\limits_{x\rightarrow -\infty} f(x) = -1$, as hinted by the horizontal asymptote.
- $\lim\limits_{x\rightarrow \infty} f(x) = \infty$, as the function is only shown to keep increasing.

For the second graph $g$, we can see that:

- $\lim\limits_{x\rightarrow -\infty} g(x) = 1$, as hinted by the horizontal asymptote.
- $\lim\limits_{x\rightarrow \infty} g(x) = 1$, as hinted by the horizontal asymptote.

# **Practice:** Determining Limits

Consider $f$ that is graphed below:

<Graph
  functions="((x+3)^2+3)/(x+2)@[-10,-2];x^3-3*x@[-2,2];x/(x-1)@[2,10]"
  asymptotes="x=-2,y=1"
  points="-2,-2~outline;2,2~outline;4,2~solid"
  ranges="[8,8,-8,-8]"
/>

Determine the limit of $f$ as $x$ approaches the following $x$ values. If necessary, enter **DNE** to indicate that a limit does not exist, or **INF** to indicate that a limit is infinity. This instruction applies to the rest of this course, when working on limits.

$x=-2$
<Practice id="determining-limits-1" answer="DNE" />
$x=2$
<Practice id="determining-limits-2" answer="2" />
$x=\infty$
<Practice id="determining-limits-3" answer="1" />

<Explanation>
Let's establish some facts:
- Limit of $f$ as $x$ approaches $-2$ from left and right, respectively, are $-\infty$ and $-2$. Since they are different, the limit doesn't exist.
- Limit of $f$ as $x$ approaches $2$ from left and right, respectively, are $2$ and $2$. Since they are the same, the limit exists.
- Limit of $f$ as $x$ approaches $\infty$ is $1$, as hinted by the horizontal asymptote on $y=1$.
