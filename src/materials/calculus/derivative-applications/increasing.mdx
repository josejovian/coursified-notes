# The Increasing and Decreasing of a Function

If $f$ is differentiable on $(a, b)$:
- If $f'(x) > 0$ for all $x$ on $(a, b)$, then it's increasing on that interval.
- If $f'(x) < 0$ for all $x$ on $(a, b)$, then it's decreasing on that interval.
- If $f'(x) = 0$ for all $x$ on $(a, b)$, then it's constant on that interval.

To find at which intervals a function become increasing or decreasing:
1. Find $f'(x)$.
2. Find any $c$ values so that $f'(c)=0$ or $f'(c)$ does not exist.
3. Separate $f$'s domain into intervals using these values.
4. For every intervals, test any value $c$ within that interval. The result $f'(c)$ will indicate whether $f$ is increasing/decreasing/constant on that interval.

<Theorem title="The First Derivative Test">
Let $c$ be $f$'s critical number on $(a, b)$, and $f$ is differentiable on $(a, b)$ with the possible exception of $c$.
-  If $f'(x)>0$ on $(a,c)$ and$f'(x)\<0$ on $(c,b)$, then $f$ has a relative maximum at $c$.
-  If $f'(x)\<0$ on $(a,c)$ and$f'(x)>0$ on $(c,b)$, then $f$ has a relative minimum at $c$.
-  If $f'(x)$ has the same sign on both intervals, then $c$ is neither $f$'s relative maximum nor minimum.
</Theorem>

Using this, we can determine a function's relative maximum and minimum, if any.

# The Increasing and Decreasing of a Function: Example

<Example>
Determine at which intervals $f(x)=x^3-3x^2$ become increasing and decreasing, as well as its relative maximum and minimum, if any.
</Example>

Derive $f$:
$$
\begin{align*}
f(x)&=x^3-3x^2\\
f'(x)&=3x^2-6x\\
6x&=3x^2\\
x^2&=2x\\
\end{align*}
$$

$f$'s critical points are $x=0$ and $x=2$, so there are three intervals: $(-\infty, 0)$, $(0, 2)$ and $(2, \infty)$.

To find out which intervals are increasing and decreasing, using $f'(x)$, we test a value $c$ in that interval.

| Interval   | $c$ | $f'(c)$ | Verdict |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| $(-\infty, 0)$ |$-1$ | $9$ | Increasing |
| $(0, 2)$ | $1$ | $-3$ | Decreasing |
| $(2, \infty)$ | $3$ | $9$ | Increasing |

Following the First Derivative Test,  we can see that $x=0$ is $f$'s relative maximum, and $x=2$ is $f$'s relative minimum.

To verify the results we calculated, observe the following graph:

# Concavity of a Function

Let $f$ be a function that has a second derivative on an open interval $I$, then
- If $f''(x) > 0$ for all $x$ on $I$, then $f$ is concave upwards on $I$.
- If $f''(x) < 0$ for all $x$ on $I$, then $f$ is concave downwards on $I$.

To find at which intervals a function become increasing or decreasing:
1. Find values $c$ so that etiher $f''(x) = 0$ or  $f''(x)$ does not exist.
2. Separate $f$'s domain into intervals using these values.
3. For every intervals, test any value $c$ within that interval. The result $f''(c)$ will indicate whether $f$ is concave upwards or downwards on that interval.

Let $f$ be a function continuous on an open interval that has the point $c$, and the function has a tangent line on point $P(c, f(c))$. If $f$'s graph concavity changes at $P$, then $P$ is said to be $f$'s inflection point.

To find a function's inflection points, find $c$ such that etiher $f''(x) = 0$ or  $f''(x)$ does not exist. Then, check if $f$'s concavity changes at that point. If that is the case, then the tested $c$ is $f$'s inflection point, provided there is a tangent line of $f$ at $P$.

The second derivative of a function can also be used to find a function's relative extrema.

<Theorem title="The Second Derivative Test">
Suppose $f$ has a continuous second derivative on an interval that contains $f$'s critical number $c$.
- If $f''(c) < 0$, then $c$ is $f$'s maximum relative.
- If $f''(c) > 0$, then $c$ is $f$'s minimum relative.
- If $f''(c) = 0$, then the test yields no result.
