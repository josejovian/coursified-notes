# Absolute Extrema of a Function

The function $f$:

- has an **absolute maximum** at $c$ if $f(x) ≤ f(c)$ for all $x$ in the $f$'s domain. $f(c)$ is $f$'s maximum value on its domain.
- has an **absolute minimum** at $c$ if $f(x) ≥ f(c)$ for all $x$ in the $f$'s domain. $f(c)$ is $f$'s minimum value on its domain.

The absolute maximum and minimum of $f$ are $f$'s **extrema** on its domain.

<Graph functions="x*x+1@red;-x*x-1@blue;1/x" />

Consider the following examples: $x^2 + 1$, $-x^2 - 1$, and $\frac{1}{x}$. By observing the graph, you know that:

- $x^2 + 1$ only has absolute minimum at $x=0$, and its minimum value is $1$. It doesn't have a maximum value.
- $-x^2 - 1$ only has absolute maximum at $x=0$, and its maximum value is $-1$. It doesn't have a minimum value.
- $\frac{1}{x}$ has neither absolute maximum nor minimum, so it has no extrema.

# Local Extrema of a Function

The function $f$:

- has a relative maximum at $c$ if $f(x) ≥ f(c)$ for all $x$ in some open interval that contains $c$.
- has a relative maximum at $c$ if $f(x) ≤ f(c)$ for all $x$ in some open interval that contains $c$.
  are $f$'s **extrema** on its domain.

<Graph functions="(x*x*x)/4-x*3" />

Consider the following example: $\frac{x^3}{4} - 3x$. By observing the graph, you know that this example has both local maximum and minimum, respectively at $x=2$ and $x=-2$. However, it has no global maximum or minimum.

# Finding Extremas

<Theorem title="Fermat's Theorem">
  If $f$ has a relative extremum at $c$, then either $f'(c) = 0$ or $f'(c)$
  doesn't exist.
</Theorem>

<Theorem title="Extreme Value Theorem">
  If $f$ is continuous on a closed interval $[a,b]$, then $f$ attains an
  absolute maximum value $f(c)$ for some number $c$ in $[a,b]$ and an absolute
  minimum value $f(d)$ for some number $d$ in $[a,b]$.
</Theorem>

<Theorem title="Critical Number">
  A function $f$ has the **critical number** $c$ in its domain, where either
  $f'(c) = 0$ or $f'(c)$ doesn't exist.
</Theorem>{" "}

This means that we can find the **extrema** of function by deriving the function, then finding the appropriate $c$ values that fulfill the above theorem(s).

# Finding Extremas: Example (1)

<Example>
  Determine the absolute maximum and minimum of the function $f(x) = x^2-x-2$
  within $[0, 2]$.
</Example>

Firstly, derive the function:

$$
\begin{align*}
f(x)&=x^2-x-2\\
f'(x)&=2x-1\\
x&=\frac{1}{2}
\end{align*}
$$

Then, we check $f$'s value when we subtitute the $x$ value we got in the first step (which is $f$'s critical point), as well as the endpoints of the interval.

| $x$    | $0$     | $\frac{1}{2}$  | $2$ |
| ------ | ------- | -------------- | --- |
| $f(x)$ | $-2$    | $-\frac{9}{4}$ | $0$ |
| Type   | Neither | Min            | Max |

Therefore, the absolute maximum and minimum of $f$ in the given interval, respectively, are $0$ and $-\frac{9}{4}$.

# Finding Extremas: Example (2)

<Example>
  Determine the absolute maximum and minimum of the function $f(x) =
  (x^2-4)\sqrt[3]{x ^ 2}$ within $[0, 2]$.
</Example>

Firstly, derive the function:

$$
\begin{align*}
f(x)&=(x^2-4)\sqrt[3]{x^2}\\
&=x^{\frac{8}{3}} - 4x^{\frac{2}{3}}\\
f'(x)&=\frac{8}{3}x^{\frac{5}{3}} - \frac{8}{3}x^{-\frac{1}{3}}\\
x^{\frac{5}{3}}&=x^{-\frac{1}{3}}\\
x^2 &= 1\\
x &= \pm 1
\end{align*}
$$

Then, we check $f$'s value when we subtitute the $x$ value we got in the first step (which is $f$'s critical point), as well as the endpoints of the interval.

| $x$    | $-1$ | $0$ | $1$  | $2$ |
| ------ | ---- | --- | ---- | --- |
| $f(x)$ | $-3$ | $0$ | $-3$ | $0$ |
| Type   | Min  | Max | Min  | Max |

Therefore, the absolute maximum and minimum of $f$ in the given interval, respectively, are $0$ and $-3$.
