# Rolle's Theorem and Mean Value Theorem

<Theorem title="Rolle's Theorem">
  Let $f$ be a continuous function on $[a,b]$ and differentiable on $(a,b)$. If
  $f(a) = f(b)$, then there exists one number $c$ in $(a,b)$ such that $f'(c) =
  0$.
</Theorem>

<Theorem title="Mean Value Theorem">
  Let $f$ be a continuous function on $[a,b]$ and differentiable on $(a,b)$.
  There exists one number $c$ in $(a,b)$ such that $f'(c)=\frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}$, which means that: - if $f'(c) = 0$ for all $x$ in interval $(a,b)$ then
  $f$ is constant on $(a,b)$. - if $f'(x) = g'(x)$ for all $x$ in interval $(a,b)$
  then $f$ and $g$ differ by a consant on $(a,b)$. Or in other words, there exists
  a constant $c$ such that $f(x) = g(x) + c$ for all $x$ in $(a,b)$.

# Rolle's Theorem: Example

<Example>
  Show that $f(x)=x^3-3x$ on $[-\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{3}]$ fulfills Rolle's Theorem,
  and find the $c$ values.
</Example>

Since $f$ is a polynomial function, it is continuous and differentiable at the given interval, and $f(-\sqrt{3})=f(\sqrt{3})=0$. This fulfills the conditions of Rolle's Theorem.

$$
\begin{align*}
f(x)&=x^3-3x\\
f'(x)&=3x^2-3\\
3&=3x^2\\
x&=\pm 1
\end{align*}
$$

The $c$ values are $1$ and $-1$.

# Mean Value Theorem: Example

<Example>
  Show that $f(x)=x^3-3x$ on $[-2, 2]$ fulfills Mean Value Theorem, and find the
  $c$ values.
</Example>

Since $f$ is a polynomial function, it is continuous and differentiable at the given interval. This fulfills the conditions of Mean Value Theorem.

$$
\begin{align*}
f(x)&=x^3-3x\\
f'(x)&=3x^2-3\\
\\
f'(c)&=\frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}\\
3c^2-3&=\frac{2 - (-2)}{2 - (-2)}\\
3c^2&= 4\\
c&=\pm \sqrt{\frac{4}{3}}
\end{align*}
$$

The $c$ values are $\sqrt{\frac{4}{3}}$ and $-\sqrt{\frac{4}{3}}$.
