# Definitions

A function's derivative is related to the instantaneous rate of change of itself at a particular point, as well as the gradient of a tangent line to a function at a particular point. The derivative of the function $f$ with respect to $x$ is the function $f'$:

$$
f'(x)=\lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}
$$

# Example of Derivative

<Example>
  Provided $f(x) = 4x^2 - 4x + 1$:
	1. Calculate $f'(x)$.
	2. At which rate is $f$
  changing at $x = \frac{1}{4}$?
	3. What is the equation of the tangent line to the graph of the function $f$ at $x = \frac{1}{4}$?
</Example>

Using the definition from before:

$$
\begin{align*}
 f'(x)
 &= \lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}\\
 &= \lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{\left [ 4(x + h)^2 - 4(x+h) + 1 \right ] - \left [ 4x^2 - 4x + 1 \right ]}{h}\\
 &= \lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{\left [ 4(x^2 + 2xh + h^2) - 4(x+h) + 1 \right ] - \left [ 4x^2 - 4x + 1 \right ]}{h}\\
 &= \lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{\left [ 8xh + 4h^2 - 4h \right ]}{h}\\
 &= \lim_{h\rightarrow 0}  8x + 4h - 4\\
 &= 8x - 4\\
\end{align*}
$$

Using this result, we can answer the second question. Substitute $x$ in to $f'(x)$, which allows us to obtain $f'(\frac{1}{4}) = -2$.  

This is also the gradient, or the slope of the tanget line described in the third question. Since the question already provides us with a $x$ value, substituting it to $f$ yields the point $(\frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{4})$.

Thus, we can now construct the tangent line equation given the point of intersect and the gradient: 

$$
\begin{align*}
y - y_1 &= m(x - x_1) \\
y - \frac{1}{4} &= (-2)(x - \frac{1}{4}) \\
y &= (-2)(x - \frac{1}{4}) + \frac{1}{4} \\
y &= -2x + \frac{3}{4} \\
\end{align*}
$$
