# Definitions

A function's derivative is related to the instantaneous rate of change of itself at a particular point, as well as the gradient of a tangent line to a function at a particular point. The derivative of the function $f$ with respect to $x$ is the function $f'$:

$$
f'(x)=\lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}
$$

Derivatives have different notations, but they still have the same meaning. The first derivative, second derivative, and the n-th derivative of a function are commonly written with these notations.

# Example of Derivative

<Example>
  Provided $f(x) = 4x^2 - 4x + 1$:
	1. Calculate $f'(x)$.
	2. At which rate is $f$ changing at $x = \frac{1} {4}$?
	3. What is the equation of the tangent line to the graph of the function $f$ at $x = \frac{1}{4}$?
</Example>

**Number 1**  
Using the definition from before:

$$
\begin{align*}
 f'(x)
 &= \lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}\\
 &= \lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{\left [ 4(x + h)^2 - 4(x+h) + 1 \right ] - \left [ 4x^2 - 4x + 1 \right ]}{h}\\
 &= \lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{\left [ 4(x^2 + 2xh + h^2) - 4(x+h) + 1 \right ] - \left [ 4x^2 - 4x + 1 \right ]}{h}\\
 &= \lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{\left [ 8xh + 4h^2 - 4h \right ]}{h}\\
 &= \lim_{h\rightarrow 0}  8x + 4h - 4\\
 &= 8x - 4\\
\end{align*}
$$

**Number 2**  
Using the answer of the first question, substitute $x$ in to $f'(x)$, which allows us to obtain $f'(\frac{1}{4}) = -2$.

**Number 3**  
The answer of the second question is the gradient, or the slope of the tanget line described in the third question. Since the question already provides us with a $x$ value, substituting it to $f$ yields the point $(\frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{4})$. Thus, we can now construct the tangent line equation given the point of intersect and the gradient:

$$
\begin{align*}
y - y_1 &= m(x - x_1) \\
y - \frac{1}{4} &= (-2)(x - \frac{1}{4}) \\
y &= (-2)(x - \frac{1}{4}) + \frac{1}{4} \\
y &= -2x + \frac{3}{4} \\
\end{align*}
$$

# Differentiability of a Function

A function is said to be differentiable at $x=a$, if $f'(a)$ exists. Consequently, by being differentiable at $x=a$, $f(x)$ is also continuous at $x=a$.

---

<Example>Is $f(x)=|x|$ differentiable at $x=0$?</Example>

Using the definition from before:

$$
\begin{align*}
 f'(x) &= \lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}\\
 &= \lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{|x+h| - |x|}{h}\\
 &= \lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{|h|}{h}\\
\end{align*}
$$

Depending on whether we approach the limit from the left or the right side, the result (limit) is different:

$$
\begin{align*}
 \lim_{h\rightarrow 0^+} \frac{|h|}{h} &= \lim_{h\rightarrow 0^+} \frac{h}{h}=1\\
 \lim_{h\rightarrow 0^-} \frac{|h|}{h} &= \lim_{h\rightarrow 0^-} -\frac{h}{h}=-1\\
\end{align*}
$$

Since the left and right side limit are different, the limit doesn't exist, and $f'(0)$ does not exist. Although the function $f$ may have been continuous at $x=0$, this does not mean the function will be differentiable at that point. Since $f'(0)$ does not exist, $f$ is not differentiable at $x=0$.
