# Implicit Differentiation

Sometimes a function is not defined as a function of $x$. Consider the circle equation $x^2+y^2=r^2$. While we can rearrange this to obtain the $y=$ form, this will not always be the case. Consider another example $x^4+4xy+y^2=5y^3$. By normal means, it is impossible to isolate $y$, which prevents us from calculating $\frac{dy}{dx}$.

In this case, implitcit differentiation is a viable solution that allows us to do so. Differentiate both sides with respect to $x$, including functions.

$$
\begin{align*}
x^4+4xy+y^2&=5y^3\\
4x^3+ 4 \left ( x\frac{dy}{dx} + y \right )+2y\frac{dy}{dx}&=15\frac{dy}{dx}y^2\\
4x^3+ 4x\frac{dy}{dx} + 4y +2y\frac{dy}{dx}&=15\frac{dy}{dx}y^2\\
4x^3+ 4y + \frac{dy}{dx} \left( 4x + 2y \right )&=15\frac{dy}{dx}y^2\\
4x^3+ 4y + \frac{dy}{dx} \left( 4x + 2y - 15y^2 \right )&=0\\
\frac{dy}{dx}&=\frac{-4x^3-4y}{4x + 2y - 15y^2}\\
\end{align*}

# Implicit Differentiation: Example

<Example>
  Given $x^3y^2+\tan{y}=x^2-4y$, find $\frac{dy}{dx}$ using implicit differentiation.
</Example>

$$
\begin{align*}
x^3y^2+\tan{y}&=x^2-4y\\
\frac{d}{dx} \left ( x^3y^2+\tan{y} \right )&= \frac{d}{dx} \left ( x^2-4y \right )\\
\left( 3x^2y^2 + 2x^3y\frac{dy}{dx} \right)+ 2\frac{dy}{dx}y + \frac{dy}{dx} \sec^2{y} &= 2x - 4 \frac{dy}{dx}\\
3x^2y^2 + \frac{dy}{dx} \left ( 2x^3y + \sec^2{y} \right ) &= 2x - 4 \frac{dy}{dx}\\
3x^2y^2 + \frac{dy}{dx} \left ( 2x^3y + \sec^2{y} + 4 \right ) &= 2x\\
\frac{dy}{dx} \left ( 2x^3y + \sec^2{y} + 4 \right ) &= 2x - 3x^2y^2\\
\frac{dy}{dx} &= \frac{2x - 3x^2y^2}{2x^3y + \sec^2{y} + 4}\\
\end{align*}
